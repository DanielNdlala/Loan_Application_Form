# Loan Registration Form

## Project Overview

This project is a simple **Loan Registration Form** built with **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript** (vanilla). It collects basic user information, including name, email, loan amount, loan term, and loan type. The project also showcases form validation and styling, which make it a great example of frontend development for your portfolio.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The form is fully responsive and works well on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

- **Interactive Alerts**: Alerts notify the user when the form is submitted successfully or when any required fields are missing.
- **Clean and Modern UI**: The form uses modern styling to create a professional user interface.
- **Console Output**: The form data is logged to the browser console upon submission.
